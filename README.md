# Financial-Analysis-Project
This final project was completed for a data skills bootcamp, involving all stages of the data analysis lifecycle from processing the raw data through to a final presentation of the findings and recommendations.
The data cleaning stage was executed in Microsoft Excel and the visualisations were created in Microsoft Power BI.  The Salary and Bonus Payment visual was a fully interactive dashboard.
